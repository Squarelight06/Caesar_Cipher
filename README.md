# Caesar_Cipher

This is a program, that mimics the behavior of just another caesar cipher program that is readily available on the web. However, I have added some features where the user gets to choose how many times each letter would be shifted. This increases the strength of the encryption as the user could think of any possible number and the text would be encrypted accordingly(different for every different number).

With that out of the way, I thought someone might want to decipher the text so I added a function that deciphers the text. The number the user provides would act as a key(variable) for the decipher function. The user also needs to provide the encrypted text which needs to be decrypted and the function does the rest.
